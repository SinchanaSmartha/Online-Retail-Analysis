From data to decisions: How Analytics Power Business

Online Retail Data Analysis – A Beginner-Friendly Journey

👋 Hi, I’m Sinchana!

This repository is special to me because it’s not just code — it’s the story of how I, a high school graduate with a love for numbers, explored how data science connects to business analysis.

In Part 1 of my journey, I wrote a small guide for students who wanted to know what data science is all about. That was about curiosity.
In this Part 2, I wanted to show how data science is actually applied in a real-world business dataset — so I picked the Online Retail dataset (from UCL).


🌍 Why Retail?

Retail is everywhere — from the corner shop to Amazon. Every purchase tells a story. And businesses don’t survive on “gut feeling” alone; they thrive on data-driven decisions.

This project is my way of showing:
	•	How raw transaction data can be cleaned and explored,
	•	How customer behaviour can be studied with simple analytics,
	•	How business questions can be answered using Python,
	•	And how all of this connects to business analysis in practice.


📂 What’s Inside
	•	Chapter 1–2: Setting the scene — why data science matters in business.
	•	Chapter 3–4: Getting our hands dirty — loading and cleaning the dataset.
	•	Chapter 5: Exploring sales patterns (top products, top customers, seasonal trends).
	•	Chapter 6: Answering business questions (like “which customers bring most value?”).
	•	Chapter 7: Customer behaviour with RFM analysis.
	•	Chapter 8: Wrapping up with conclusions.
	•	Chapter 9: How this analysis could be turned into a business analyst’s report.

Alongside each step, I included code + outputs + my narration, so it reads more like a guided story than a dry tutorial.


🛠 Tools Used

I kept it simple:
	•	Python (main language)
	•	NumPy (math & arrays)
	•	Pandas (data wrangling — yes, I caved in and used it 😊)



📊 Dataset

The dataset is Online Retail II, available on UCI Machine Learning Repository.
I did not upload the raw dataset here (too large + license), but you can download it yourself and place it in a data/ folder.



🚀 How to Run
	1.	Clone this repo.
	2.	Download the Online Retail II dataset (Excel file) and save it in data/.
	3.	Open my Jupyter Notebook / Python script.
	4.	Run step by step — you’ll see both code and storytelling.



✨ My Takeaway

This project taught me that data science isn’t just about models or math — it’s about asking the right business questions and using data to answer them.

If you’re a student like me, I hope this repo helps you see how data science and business analysis work together.


🤝 Connect

I’d love to hear from you if you’re also exploring data science!


👉 Sinchana’s note: This is not a professional “final product” but my learning journey, shared openly so others can learn (and smile at my beginner mistakes).
